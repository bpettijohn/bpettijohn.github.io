    name: James Martens
    company: Blue Nile
    text: Benjamin has been working for me for the past several months, helping us with our efforts to rebrand our website and simultaneously implement a style-guide and have the pages laid out on a CSS grid.  He has been a huge help to us.  He’s a knowledgeable professional who has integrated seamlessly with the rest of the Site Development team, and he has both taken the initiative and developed solutions where there was only minimal direction, and he has embraced and modified code whenever specific direction did come to take a different approach.  He’s a good frontend developer, knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  He has also helped with some React components that we are building.  I would not hesitate to employ Benjamin again in the future.
